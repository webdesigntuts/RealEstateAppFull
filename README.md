## Install Node Modules
cd frontend\
npm install\
cd backend\
npm install

## Run The app As I did on Youtube
Go to frontend folder and type "npm run start" for the react-app\
Then go to the backend folder and type "npm run develop" for the strapi backend

## Available Scripts (frontend)
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

## Available Scripts (backend)
### `npm run strapi develop`,
### `npm run strapi start`
### `npm run strapi build`
